The plan is to create a simple hangman like program.
The computer chooses a random word from an array item,
that gets the words from a .txt file.
The user is shown a diagram of a gallow,
The user has 6 turns(6 body parts) to guess the word

Create a class that loads the words.txt file and turns it into
an array
Create a class that facilitates the game,
Don't allow it to do too much besides assigning the word
array to an instance variable, picking a random word and
calling the game
